# SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY !!!
A Search Engine for Internet Memes

New memes are created every second, they are viral by nature. Anybody may create and share new material on the major internet meme portals. Hence, quality of content can decrease due to inferior memes being spread around the internet, resulting in users being provided with a sub-standard subset of memes and making the task of filtering bad memes difficult.
Hence this project aims to diminish the above problem, introducing the design and implementation of a search engine dedicated to internet memes. It provides tools for searching and browsing content from popular internet meme content providers across the web. In essence, the search engine functions in a similar fashion to Google Image search, providing users with a centralized interface for finding and browsing the latest and most popular internet memes.
